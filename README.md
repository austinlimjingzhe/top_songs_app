# Top Songs Application
A Python implementation of a YouTube views scraper + Flask application displaying the Top Songs of a Playlist by Weekly Views.

## Introduction
Since YouTube has effectively invalidated my previous project on a Dislikes Checker, I was trying to find another YouTube Data API project to work on in my spare time. 

This project was inspired by the work done by members of the Hololive community,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC94Mhi_4KZNX7bzHaoBnRTw">ホロ歌は癒しの万能薬hololive songs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjDIiKHIhKuBxxmJVnW3vg">柊すいかのホロ歌部</a>, who have spent much effort in compiling the most viewed songs released by the talents of Hololive. Currently being a manual process, this project sought to automate the scraping of view counts and generation of a top N list of songs.

The following video shows a demonstration of the application:
